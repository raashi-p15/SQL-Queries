<h1>Writing basic SQL Queries</h1>

<h2>📌Objective</h2>
<mark>Extracting data from one or more tables</mark><br>
In this task, I've used a student database with various different tables to dive deep into and gain practical knowledge related to SQL DQL containing a number of diverse statements.


<h2> 📁 What's in this Repository? </h2>
1. <mark>README.md</mark> --> Project Description <br>
2. <mark>Data_insert_scriptfile.sql</mark> --> SQL script with student data - tables STUDENT, course, and HOD<br>
3. <mark>Data_insert_scriptfile.sql</mark> --> SQL script with SELECT, ORDER BY, WHERE, LIMIT statements.

<h2>🛠️ Tools and SQL Techniques Used</h2>
1. MySQL Workbench <br>
2. Basic SQL statement : <br>
      <mark>SELECT</mark> (retrieval of data from tables)<br>
      <mark>WHERE</mark> (cleause to put a condition to extract specific data) <br>
     <mark>ORDER BY</mark> (SORT extracted data in ascending or descending order) <br>
      <mark>LIMIT</mark> (set a limit to the amount of rows retrieved) <br>
      <mark>AND</mark> (add a condition in the WHERE clause)<br>
      <mark>OR</mark> (add a condition in the WHERE clause)
      <mark>BETWEEN</mark> (set a range limit for the extracted data)
      <mark>LIKE</mark> (wildcard for data retrieval condition)
      <mark>AS</mark> (alias for the columns to be retrieved)
      
<h2> 📈 Insights Derived </h2>
- Entire table data retrieval through SELECT statement <br>
- Sorting data with ORDER BY<br>
- Adding conditions with WHERE clause<br>
- Adding more than one conditions with AND, OR<br>
- Setting range limit with BETWEEN<br>
- Using alias with AS<br>
- Adding wildcards with LIKE<br>


<h2>📋Developer's Note</h2>
This task is meant to familarize you with basic SQL statements, commands, conditions, aliases, and clauses that help you to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.
